This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!


About Me
======
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Critical Game Design program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Previously, I was a Technical Audio Designer at Papergames, where I worked on [Infinity Nikki](https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home). My current research focuses on game audio, immersive audio, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for music, and AI in audio.
