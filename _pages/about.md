I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Critical Game Design program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Previously, I was a Technical Audio Designer at Papergames, where I worked on [Infinity Nikki](https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home). My current research focuses on game audio, immersive audio, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for music, and AI in audio.
